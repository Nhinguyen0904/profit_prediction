# Profit Prediction
The project aims to build a machine learning model to predict companies' profits based on attributes in R&D spending, administration spending and marketing spending, using an avaiable dataset of 1000 companies on Kaggle.
# Parts of the Data Science project
1. Understand the dataset, drop irrelvant attribute, quick cleaning to make all variables consistent in naming.
2. Conduct some exploratory data analysis, focused on visualizing the data distribution of all variables and examine the correlation between input variables and the target/out variable which is profit.
3. Build 2 machine learning models, linear regression and random forest regression to predict profit based on the attribute variables, compare the R2 score and MSE score to select a better-performing model when producing outputs for unseen data (data in test set).
